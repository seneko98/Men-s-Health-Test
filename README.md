Project Overview
Men's Health Test Bot is an innovative Telegram bot designed to provide comprehensive health analysis and personalized recommendations based on Dr. Braverman's methodology for neurochemical and hormonal profiling. The bot integrates cutting-edge Web3 technology using Solana blockchain to store test results securely and offer token-based premium features.
Key Features
Health Analysis
Neurochemical Profile Assessment: Analyzes key neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, GABA, noradrenaline)
Hormonal Profile Evaluation: Measures testosterone, estradiol, cortisol levels
Systemic Health Checkup: Assesses liver function, sleep quality
BMI Calculation: Provides personalized interpretation based on body type
Web3 Integration
Phantom Wallet Connection: Secure verification of Solana wallet ownership
Blockchain Data Storage: Records test results on Solana blockchain (DevNet)
Token-Based Economy: Rewards users with tokens for wallet verification and test completion
Premium Features: Extended analysis and recommendations available for tokens
Integration with Solana Explorer: Links will be provided to view transactions in the Solana Explorer. Additionally, NFTs will be issued upon completion of tests, during the interpretation of analyses, and for storage in the wallet. These NFTs can also be used to track improvements or declines in performance metrics over time.
Personalized Recommendations
Laboratory Tests: Customized recommendations for blood tests and health examinations
Supplement Guide: Personalized supplements based on identified deficiencies
Exercise Protocols: Tailored physical activity programs
Lifestyle Adjustments: Sleep, nutrition, and stress management advice
Premium Content
Hair Loss Prevention: Specialized protocols for male pattern baldness
Sexual Health: Evidence-based solutions for libido and erectile function
Muscle Building: Optimized hormonal approaches to muscle development
Weight Management: Hormone-centric weight loss strategies
Women's Health: Menstrual cycle optimization and hormonal balance guides
Technical Implementation
Programming Language and Libraries
Core Language: Python 3.9+
Telegram Interface: python-telegram-bot v20.0
Blockchain Connection: Solana Web3 simulation (DevNet mode)
Database: MongoDB simulation (for demo purposes)
Asynchronous Operations: asyncio
Architecture
The bot implements a conversation-based architecture with state management:
ConversationHandler: Manages user dialog flow
State Management: Tracks user position in conversation flow
Mock Database: Simulates data persistence for demo purposes
Blockchain Integration: Simulates Solana DevNet transactions
Web3 Integration Details
Wallet Verification: Two-step verification process (address + test transaction)
On-Chain Storage: Test results are recorded with transaction hashes
Token Economy: Both earning (registration, test completion) and spending (premium features)
Blockchain Explorer Integration: Links to view transactions on Solana Explorer
Requirements
Software Requirements

Python Dependencies






bash


# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mens-health-solana-bot.git
cd mens-health-solana-bot

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure your Telegram bot token
# Edit TOKEN variable in mens_health_solana_bot.py

# Run the bot
python mens_health_solana_bot.py



Development Logic
The development approach prioritized:
Modular Design: Separate components for Telegram interactions, health analysis, and blockchain integration
Asynchronous Processing: Non-blocking operations for responsive user experience
Simulated Blockchain: DevNet integration for demonstration without real cryptocurrency risk
Extensible Architecture: Easy addition of new tests, recommendations, and features
Error Resilience: Multiple retry mechanisms and comprehensive error handling
For Hackathon Judges
This project demonstrates innovative integration of healthcare and blockchain technologies:
Privacy-First Approach: Personal health data stored securely on blockchain
Incentivized Health Monitoring: Token rewards for completing health assessments
Decentralized Health Records: Immutable storage of test results
Tokenized Premium Health Services: Blockchain-based marketplace for health recommendations
To evaluate the demo:
Start the bot with /start
Connect a Phantom wallet (or skip)
Complete the basic health assessment
Receive blockchain-verified results
Explore premium features with earned tokens
The demo runs in simulation mode, so no real Solana transactions are made, and no MongoDB connection is required.
